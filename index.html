<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin Madison, advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/">Prof. Aditya Akella</a>
and <a href="http://shivaram.org/">Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman</a>. I am broadly interested in Systems, but my current research interests are aligned towards Big Data Systems and Serverless Computing.</p>
<p><font color="blue"> Our work on accelerating Deep Learning Inference on the Cloud using a technique called Freeze Inference has been accepted to appear in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud19/">HotCloud'19</a></font></p>
