<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I currently work with AWS Aurora group out of East Palo Alto on building large-scale, highly available OLTP databases.</p>
<p>I was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin Madison, advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/">Prof. Aditya Akella</a>
and <a href="http://shivaram.org/">Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman</a>. I am broadly interested in Systems, but my current research interests are aligned towards Big Data Systems and Serverless Computing.</p>
